Changes
=======

19.03.0b2 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

 - Minor fix for the CLI to show extra error details only when they are present.

19.03.0b1 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

 - Support API v4.20190315 and change GraphQL fields for various admin commands
   to match with the v19.03 series server.

   This renders the client after this version won't be compatible with old servers.

 - Fix various bugs.

18.12.1 (2018-01-21)
--------------------

 - Automatically detect the legacy mode (API version &lt;= v4.20181215).
   Removed "--legacy" option for the "run" command.

18.12.0 (2018-01-06)
--------------------

 - Fix various bugs.

18.12.0a2 (2018-12-21)
----------------------

 - NEW: "admin images" command to show the kernel images registered to the server.

 - Improve error displays.

 - Explicitly set connection timeout only for potentially long-running requests such
   as file uploads/downloads and kernel creation.


18.12.0a1 (2018-12-14)
----------------------

 - NEW: "app" command for app service ports! You can now connect to Jupyter Notebook
   and other services running in the compute sessions directly!

 - NEW: "start" command which starts a compute sessino but does not anything.

 - Adopt Click (CLI toolkit) for better Windows support and future shell
   autocompletion support.

 - "ps" and "admin sessions" commands show more detailed resource statistics,
   includign real-time memory usage.

 - Revamp the SDK documentation: https://docs.client-py.backend.ai

1.5.1 (2018-12-03)
------------------

 - Display CLI errors with more details, including server-generated extra messages
   and fully formatted exception arguments line-by-line.

 - Fix a regression bug in the kernel file download API.

1.5.0 (2018-11-26)
------------------

 - Support API v4's authentication mechanism which skips the request body when
   calculating auth signatures.  (This will be the preferred way in favor of
   streaming-based APIs.)

 - Rewrite the low-level request APIs and API function implementations.
   Now all APIs are written in async codes first and then wrapped as synchronous APIs
   if non-async Session is used.

 - Due to a large amount of internal changes, we bump the version to v1.5.0
   before going to v18.12.0 series.

1.4.2 (2018-11-06)
------------------

 - Improve handling of unspecified resource shares.

 - Internal updates for test cases and test dependencies.

1.4.1 (2018-10-30)
------------------

 - Hotfix for regression in `Kernel.stream_pty()` method.

1.4.0 (2018-09-23)
------------------

 - Support download and deletion of virtual folder files.
   Check `backend.ai vfolder --help` for new commands!

 - Allow customization of keypairs when creating new one via extra arguments.
   See `backend.ai admin keypairs add --help` for available options.

 - Accept both integer and string values in `-u` / `--user` arguments for
   Backend.AI v1.4+ forward compatibility.

1.3.7 (2018-06-19)
------------------

 - Fix use of synchronous APIs inside asyncio-based applications using a separate
   worker thread that needs to be shut down manually.
   (e.g., our Jupyter notebook kernel plugin)

 - Synchronous API users now MUST call "ai.backend.client.request.shutdown()"
   function when their application exits.

 - Update dependencies (aiohttp and aioresponses)

1.3.6 (2018-06-02)
------------------

 - Fix installation warnings about aiohttp/async_timeout/attrs version mismatch
   with the new pip 10 series.

   NOTE: A workaround is to add `--upgrade-strategy=eager` option to `pip install`
   command.

1.3.4 (2018-04-08)
------------------

 - Add progress bars when uploading files to kernel/vfolder in CLI. (#23)

 - Drop dependency to requests and use aiohttp all the time, in favor of
   better streaming request/response handling for large files.
   Synchronous APIs will implicitly spawn event loops if not already there,
   via `asyncio.get_event_loop()`.  You may also pass a loop object explicitly.

 - Remove default timeout (10 secs) in asynchronous requests, to allow
   large file uploads that takes longer than that.

1.3.3 (2018-04-05)
------------------

 - Hotfix for passing environment variables when creating new kernels.

1.3.2 (2018-03-28)
------------------

 - Fix missing date object/header when making websocket requests.

 - run command: Show the name and URL of files generated by the kernel.

 - Upgrade aiohttp to v3.1 series, which introduces bugfixes and improvements in
   websocket handling.

1.3.0 (2018-03-20)
------------------

 - Add support for BACKEND_VFOLDER_MOUNTS environment variable. (#21)
   This allows use of auto-mounted vfolders when using 3rd-party integrations such as
   Jupyter notebook.  The format is a list of comma-separated strings for the vfolder
   names.

 - Individual API Function objects such as Kernel can now have individual
   APIConfig objects via optional "config" parameters to static/class methods
   and the per-instance config attribute. (#20)

 - Improve vfolder CLI command outputs.

 - Improve scripting support: all CLI commands that fail now return exit code 1
   explicitly.

1.2.1 (2018-03-08)
------------------

 - BackendError is now normal Exception, not BaseException.
   This was a mistake in the early stage of development.

1.2.0 (2018-03-08)
------------------

 - Fixed vfolder upload API to work with aiohttp v3.

 - "vfolder upload" command can now upload multiple files.

1.1.11 (2018-03-07)
-------------------

 - Change StreamPty methods to become coroutines to match with aiohttp v3
   API changes.

1.1.10 (2018-03-04)
-------------------

 - Fix file upload handling in the asyncio version.

 - Stringifying exception classes now use the output of "repr()".

1.1.9 (2018-03-02)
------------------

 - Improve asyncio exception handling.
   Now it does NOT silently swallow CancelledError/TimeoutError and other
   non-aiohttp errors!

1.1.8 (2018-03-01)
------------------

 - Upgrade to use aiohttp v3 series.

 - Improve handling of base directories outside the current working directory
   when uploading files for the batch mode execution.

 - Display exit code if available in the batch mode execution.

1.1.7 (2018-01-09)
------------------

 - Hotfix: Add missing "ai.backend.client.cli.admin" module in the package.

1.1.6 (2018-01-06)
------------------

 - Apply authentication to websocket requests as well.

 - Fix the client-side validation of client token length.

1.1.5 (2018-01-05)
------------------

 - Relicensed to MIT License to motivate integration with commercial/proprietary
   software products.

 - Lots of CLI improvements!

   - Add "terminate" command.

   - Add more "run" command options.  Now it does NOT terminate the session after
     execution by default, and you can force it using "--rm" option.

   - Add "admin keypairs" command and its subcommands for managing keypairs.

   - Add "admin agents" command to list agent instances.

   - "ps" and "admin session" commands now correctly show the client-given session ID
     token instead of the master kernel ID of the session.

   - Add "logs" command.

 - Fix a continuation bug of the "run" command when using the batch-mode, which
   has caused a mismatch of run ID management of the agent and the internal task
   queue of the kernel runner, resulting an indefinite hang up with two legitimate
   subsequent requesting of batch-mode executions.

   As being a reference implementation of the execution loop, all API users are
   advised to review and fix their client-side codes.

 - Now the client sets a custom User-Agent header value as follows:
   "Backend.AI Client for Python X.X.X" where X.X.X is the version.

1.1.1 (2017-12-04)
------------------

 - Add mount ("-m"), environment variable ("-e") arguments to CLI "run" command
   which can be specified multiple times.
   This deprecates "-b" and "-e" abbreviations for "--build" and "--exec".

 - Fix garbled tabular outputs of CLI commands in Python versions less than 3.6
   due to non-preserved dictionary ordering.

1.1.0 (2017-11-17)
------------------

**NEW**

 - Now the CLI supports "vfolder" subcommands.

1.0.6 (2017-11-16)
------------------

**CHANGES**

 - Now it uses "api.backend.ai" as the default endpoint.

 - It also searches `BACKEND_`-prefixed environment variables first and then
   falls back to `SORNA_`-prefixed environment variables as legacy.

1.0.5 (2017-11-02)
------------------

**CHANGE**

 - Remove `simplejson` from our dependencies.

1.0.4 (2017-10-31)
------------------

**NEW**

 - Add "-s" / "--stats" option to the CLI "run" command.
   When specified, the CLI shows resource usage statistics after session termination.

1.0.3 (2017-10-18)
------------------

**NEW**

 - Now you can run the CLI commands using "backend.ai"
   instead of "python -m ai.backend.client.cli"

 - Add a few new CLI commands: config, help, ps

 - Running "backend.ai" without any args shows the help message
   instead of an error.

   - Package import path: "sorna" → "ai.backend.client"
   - Class names: "SornaError" / "SornaAPIError" → "BackendError" / "BackendAPIError"
   - Any mention of "Sorna" in the API headers → "BackendAI".
     e.g., "X-Sorna-Version" API request header → "X-BackendAI-Version"

 - Refactor the internal structure for sync/async API functions.
