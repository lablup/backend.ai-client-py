Multiple breaking changes related to pagination and CLI outputs:
- The CLI command hierarchy and arguments are revamped to be much more consistent with enumeration and item queries, and to support global options such as `--output=json` and `-y`/`--yes` flags. This is not backward-compatible due to parsing ambiguity.
- When invoking the functional APIs to retrieve the details and lists, you need to change your `fields` arguments to be a list of `FieldSpec` objects instead of strings.  You may refer `ai.backend.client.output.fields` for predefined field definitions and individual functional API modules for their default list/detail field sets.
  You may also define and pass your own `FieldSpec` and `OutputFormatter` objects as well.
- Now the Client SDK requires Python 3.8 or higher to run.
